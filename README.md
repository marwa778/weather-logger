- for custom libraries i used retrofit for network calls

- for optional tasks I've implemented the following:
1. Implement ‘More details’ screen (with ability to view more detailed information
   about weather data returned from API)
   
2. Animations, transitions between screens 

3. Use Kotlin instead of Java for MainActivity
